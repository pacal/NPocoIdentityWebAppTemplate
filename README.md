# NPocoIdentity WebApp Template
These templates are based on the ASP.Net 4.52 MVC Template using the Individual User Account Authentication option.

The Template in [Master](https://github.com/pacal/NPocoIdentity_WebApp_Template) makes use of the default NPoco Identity User which contains all the properties from the Entity Framework based one.

The Template in the [Branch](https://github.com/pacal/NPocoIdentity_WebApp_Template/tree/Implement_INPocoIdentity)  gives and example of how to implement a custom Identity User by implementing the INPocoIdentity interface and adding properties to it.

For additional information see the documentation for the NPoco Identity Provider here:
